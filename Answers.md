The are popular apps that generate a lot of atetion so they have the most ratings.


8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.

They have realtive lower number of ratings and its easier to get the full 5 star rating.

9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?

We see that if you reach an larger enough audince the  top ratings are hard to achieve. 
Due to the law of big numbers you will find someone that had aproblem with your app and will give it a lower rating.

10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?

I would see what is the top 25% of total ratings given by the full datset and look for the best rated apps that have more than the required total ratings given.

11. Does people care about the price? Do some queries, comment why are you doing them and the results you retrieve. What is your conclusion?

By diving the databse by quartiles of Total Ratings Given we can Average the User Ratings inside those quartiles. Then we see the difference bet ween those wiht price 0 and those with price lager than 0.
The results are that for the top 25% of Total Ratings given if you have a price of 0 your average User Rating is of 4.24 and the average Total Ratings are over 49000. While for price of above 0 your Average User Rating is of 4.32 and your average Total Ratings are over 15500. 
The main conclusion is that by having a free app you might have a bigger audience but your ratings will not be as high as a paid version.
